/*
Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) 
together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and
 can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

To achieve encapsulation in Java âˆ’
    (01)Declare the variables of a class as private.
    (02)Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

/*
Benefits of Encapsulation
    (01)The fields of a class can be made read-only or write-only.
    (02)A class can have total control over what is stored in its fields.
